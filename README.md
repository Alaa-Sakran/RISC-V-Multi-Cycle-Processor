# RISC-V Multi-Cycle Processor

This repository contains my design for a Multi-Cycle RISC-V processor with a reduced ISA and no extensions. This design was created after completing the single-cycle design. 

## Supported Instructions

The processor supports the following instruction set:
- **Load/Store Instructions**: `lw`, `sw`
- **R-Type Instructions**: Standard arithmetic and logical operations
- **I-Type Instructions**: Immediate arithmetic and logical operations
- **Upper Immediate Instruction**: `lui`
- **Branch Instructions**: `beq`, `blt`
- **Jump Instructions**: `jal`, `jalr`

## Documentation

For more detailed information about the design, please refer to the attached PDF file.
